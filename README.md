# 🎓 Micro-Certification NFT Platform

## 📝 Project Title
**Micro-Certification NFT Platform – Certify Small Course Modules**

---

## 📄 Project Description

This project provides a decentralized platform where educational institutions or instructors can issue **micro-certificates** for short courses or skills. These certificates are issued as **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** using Clarity smart contracts on the **Stacks blockchain**.

Each NFT acts as a digital proof of learning that is **verifiable**, **tamper-proof**, and **owned by the student**.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

To empower learners with **trustless, secure, and verifiable credentials** for micro-skills, bridging the gap between online learning and recognized achievement. This project removes the need for centralized authorities by leveraging blockchain transparency.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Add support for **visual certificates stored on IPFS** (e.g., PDF or PNG).
- Enable **badge metadata**, such as course duration, instructor name, and grade.
- Build a **user-friendly frontend dashboard** to view owned NFTs.
- Allow institutions to **revoke or expire certificates** if needed.
- Integrate with **LMS (Learning Management Systems)** like Moodle, Canvas, or Google Classroom.
